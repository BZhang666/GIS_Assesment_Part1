## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
NHSData<- read_csv("NHSDATA.csv")
NHSData <- data.frame(NHSData)
NHSMapSF <- read_shape("England_nhsat_2013/england_nhsat_2013.shp", as.sf = TRUE)
NHSMapSP <- as(NHSMapSF, "Spatial")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot}
qtm(NHSMapSF)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
